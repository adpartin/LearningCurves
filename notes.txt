Each data shard needs to run through HPO. Thus, the data indexes for each shards need to be saved and not generated during the execusion of learning curves.

For the previous code of learning curves, I got good results for top6_cv_simple, AUC1, rna, dsc, cv_folds=5.
I used the entire set of features (I don't know how Rick have imputed the missing values).
In that run NN and attention NN outperformed LGBM.
